<h1>Applications In Everyday Life</h1>
<h3>What can quantum computing improve in our everyday lives?</h3>
<p>Quantum computers can improve many aspects of our lives. One example is faster optmization routes. For example, if a delivery truck had a long and complicated route, the quantum computer would be able to determine the shortest and most direct route.</p>
<p>With quantum technology, it is possible that quantum computers will be able to crack the cryptography we use today. Data encryption is a one way function. An algorithm encodes the data into a scrambled, unreadable version of the information. Sometimes the encoded infromation is so large that classical computers cannot decode the data. Shor's algorithm, which is a quantum algorithm, is used to factor these large numbers of encoded data and is much faster than a regular computer. This technology puts encrypted messages at risk. However, quantum computers are not large enough to perform this algorithm yet.</p>
