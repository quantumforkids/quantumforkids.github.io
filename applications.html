<h1>Applications In Everyday Life</h1>
<h3>What can quantum computing improve in our everyday lives?</h3>
<p>Quantum computers can improve many aspects of our lives. One example is faster optmization routes. For example, if a delivery truck had a long and complicated route, the quantum computer would be able to determine the shortest and most direct route.</p>
<p>With quantum technology, it is possible that quantum computers will be able to crack the cryptography we use today. However, ust as it will be easier to crack codes, quantum technology can also help fortify data encryption.</p>
